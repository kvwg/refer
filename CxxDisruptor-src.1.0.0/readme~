You can import the project in Qt Creator by open the project in the
CMakeLists.txt file.

To build from commandline do:
1. change into the directory where you extracted the tar file.
2. $ cmake .
3. $ make all
You should now have a libCxxDisruptor.so file containg a library
you can link into your code.
