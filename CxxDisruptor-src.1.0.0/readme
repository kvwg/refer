You can import the project in Qt-Creator by open the project in the
CMakeLists.txt file.

To build from the command line do:
1. Change into the directory where you extract the tar file.
2. $ cmake .
3. $ make all
You should now have a libCxxDisruptor.so file containg a library
you can link into your code.
You can also use the already prepared file in the build directory.
